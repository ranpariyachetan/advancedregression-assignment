## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data to be analyzes is provided in a CSV file. The data dictionnary is also provided in a text file.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
- The assignment is to build a regression model using regularisation. The model will be used to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

# Goal
The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.
3. Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
